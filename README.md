# [DontspyEU](https://dontspy.eu)

![](https://dontspy.eu/logo/6.png)

This is a campaign developed with:

1. gohugo.io framework (very poorly organized template and content logic: sorry in advance if you want to help there)
2. [face-api.js](https://vladmandic.github.io/face-api/demo/webcam.html)
3. mongodb (necessary to run the backend and other scripts)

---

Additional ideas should be discussed in the [issues](https://github.com/hermescenter/dontspyeu/issues), and in the Matrix channel [#dontspyeu:matrix.org](https://app.element.io/#/room/#dontspyeu:matrix.org).
