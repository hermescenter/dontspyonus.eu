# `1` Spread this message among AI pratictiones: We need someone winning the prizes, **we need people playing with MEPs faces** before a multi billion market start to play over ours.

# `2` Support the competitions! The **donation mentioning "don't spy eu" would be shared among the firsts and second prizes**.
