A web-based news portal application for the SISDA of North Sumatra Province, my job here is to design the appearance and work on the backend, where the backend uses PHP with the Codeigniter 3 framework, for the core itself there is already a boilerplate from the North Sumatra Provincial Government Bappeda IT team, so it's just a matter of developing it.
