Medan In Code was created using one of the most famous static generator pages, HUGO, Medan In Code is a blog that contains my writings (for now) about various programming tutorials, databases or other things related to technology.

For now, the only contributor is me, but I open up opportunities if there are friends who want to write on Medanincode.com. In Medanincode.com there are also free programming books, and open source source code for the future.
