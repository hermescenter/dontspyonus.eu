# The competitions:

<br />

## âœ¨ [Open Data Faces](/list) competition n.1: Pull our data and enrich them with additional layer of face analysis. For example: compare them to a list of MugShots, or run some crazy AI system that attributes characteristic. We know it shouldn't work that way, but once it get legitimate, it is only a marketing problem to make it belivable. Be creative! we need to highlist that once face bioemtry get in the market, some stupid usage would happen. **We should anticipate it, to raise the alarm**.

<br />

## âœ¨ [FakeFaces](/fakeface) competition n.2: Produce a deepfake image, put a Member of the Paliament where they have never been. Once RBI become legitimate, also material online would be affected, hence remembering that modern AI can produce perfectly belivable fake images is the goal of this contest.
