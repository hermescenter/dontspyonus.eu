# The competitions:

<br />

## âœ¨ [Open Data Faces](/list) **Pull our data and enrich them with additional layer of face analysis**. For example: compare them to a list of MugShots, or run some crazy AI system that attributes characteristic. We know it shouldn't work that way, but once AI biometry would be legitimate, it is only a marketing problem to make it belivable. **Be creative!** we need to highlist that once face bioemtry get in the market, some stupid usage would happen. **We should anticipate it, to raise the alarm**.

<br />

## âœ¨ [FakeFaces](/fakeface) **Produce a deepfake image, put a Member of the Paliament where they have never been**. Once Face biometry would be legitimate, also **online material** could be affected, hence remembering that modern AI can produce perfectly belivable fake images is the goal of this contest.
