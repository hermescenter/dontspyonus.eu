### This website would be updated to face the next phase; At the moment the contest are suspended, and the target would be refocus.

# Act VOTE day: everyone has the right to be protected by invasive surveillance technology. Here's how to test RBI algorithms on MEPs

# Will the European Parliament ban **face surveillance technologies** used **by police and private companies** in public spaces?

<div id="facelist-0" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Face recognition in public spaces, as well as the categorisation of peopleâ€™s emotions, gender and ethnicity, **erodes freedom of assembly, enables discrimination**, and sets a precedent â€” opening the door to future human rights violations

<div id="facelist-1" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Members of the European Parliament are considering banning some of these harmful practices

# This campaign aims to ensure that **NOBODY can use face surveillance technologies in public spaces**

<div id="facelist-2" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Not in real-time, not later on using public footage. Not using images scraped from the internet. **Never**: forbidden forever

# We will run a few experiments **to let European decision-makers better comprehend** the issues they have the power to halt

<div id="facelist-3" class="container img__limit"></div>

# What if the AI Act fails to ban face recognition and categorisation in public? Letâ€™s see! We have collected all the MEPs' faces and analysed them with software currently available to anyone

<div id="facelist-4" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Similarly to how the surveillance data market examines individuals' faces for 'enrichment,' you can explore the [Open Data Faces](/list) ðŸ¤©, access the openly released data, and apply AI attribution models to gain insights

# Itâ€™s **neither reliable nor accurate**, and itâ€™s likely to lead to discrimination. But that has not stopped companies and governments from using these systems against us

<div id="facelist-5" class="container img__limit"></div>

# To effectively simulate the unethical data market, we've also launched a contest. **The winner will be the wildest, scariest, or most original** data â€˜enrichmentâ€™

{{<prize>}}

# **DeepFakes are also a modern problem**. We can't avoid that they might be produced, but **if legitimized**, massive biometry system like `pimeyes` or `clearview` would incorporate the false information to the victim profile. **With no control or awareness for the affected citizen**

# It summarize why there is a **second contest**, about producing the most surprising [MEP DeepFake](/fakeface)

{{<prize>}}

<div id="facelist-6" class="container img__limit"></div>

# You can help this campaign in different ways. **If you want to help ban face recognition, emotion recognition and face categorisation** consider the [following options](/post/support-us) to get involved

<div id="facelist-7" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Right now, the prizes are small, but they will grow through [donations](/post/support-us)

# To **participate in the contests**, you need to send a tweet mentioning @HermesCenter and using hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dontspyeu" target=_blank>#dontspyeu</a>

<div id="facelist-8" class="container img__limit"></div>

# If youâ€™re producing **a tool, add a link**. If youâ€™re producing a **picture, mention the original MEP**. See more details in [Open Data Faces](/list), and [FakeFace](/fakeface) pages

# Needless to say, **weâ€™ll stop the campaign if the European Parliament will permanently bans all these types of face surveillance**

<div id="facelist-9" class="container img__limit"></div>

# **Weâ€™ll assign the prizes based on the sum of retweets and favorites**, when the campaign finishes, or at the end of May at the latest
