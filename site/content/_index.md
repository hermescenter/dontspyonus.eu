# Will the European Parliament ban **face surveillance technologies** used **by police and private companies** in public spaces?

<div id="facelist-0" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Face recognition in public spaces, as well as the categorisation of peopleâ€™s emotions, gender and ethnicity, **erodes freedom of assembly, enables discrimination**, and sets a precedent â€” opening the door to future human rights violations.

<div id="facelist-1" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Members of the European Parliament are considering banning some of these harmful practices.

# This campaign wants to ensure that **NOBODY can use face surveillance technologies in public spaces**.

<div id="facelist-2" class="container img__limit"></div>

# Not in real-time, not later on using public footage. Not using images scraped from the internet. **Never**: forbidden forever!

# To let **European decision-makers** better understand the problem that they have **the power to stop**, we want to run a few experiments.

<div id="facelist-3" class="container img__limit"></div>

# What would happen if the AI Act fails to ban face recognition and categorisation in public? Letâ€™s see! We have collected all the faces from the European Parliament website and analysed them with software currently available to anyone.

<div id="facelist-4" class="container img__limit"></div>

# In the same way the surveillance data market analyses peopleâ€™s faces to â€˜enrichâ€™ them, you can consult the [Open Data Faces](/list), pull the data weâ€™re releasing openly, and **run some AI attribution models on them** ðŸ¤© 

# Itâ€™s **not reliable or accurate**, and itâ€™s **likely to lead to discrimination**. But that has not stopped companies and governments using these systems against us!

<div id="facelist-5" class="container img__limit"></div>

# To properly simulate the unethical data market, this is also a contest. The winner will be the wildest, scariest, or most original data â€˜enrichmentâ€™.

{{<prize>}}

# **DeepFakes are also a modern problem**. Although they unlawfully scrape the internet for existing faces to exploit, for **a massive face surveillance system** the information provenience doesnâ€™t matter.

# Join the second contest: [MEP DeepFake](/fakeface)!

<div id="facelist-6" class="container img__limit"></div>

# You can help this campaign in different ways; **If you want to help ban face recognition, emotion recognition and face categorisation** consider to see the three ways you can help.

<div id="facelist-7" class="container img__limit"></div>

# The prizes are not big, **Today**. But you can [donate to increse the prizes](/help).

# To **participate in the contests**, you need to send a tweet mentioning @HermesCenter and using hashtag #dontspyeu

<div id="facelist-8" class="container img__limit"></div>

# If youâ€™re producing **a tool, add a link**. If youâ€™re producing a **picture, mention the original MEP**. See more details in [Open Data Faces](/list), and [FakeFace](/fakeface) pages.


# Of course, **weâ€™ll stop the campaign if the European Parliament permanently bans all these types of face surveillance**.

<div id="facelist-9" class="container img__limit"></div>

# **Weâ€™ll assign the prizes based on the sum of retweets and favorites**, when the campaign finishes, or at the end of May at the latest.
