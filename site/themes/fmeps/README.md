I'm basing this template on [Hugo Alexa Portfolio](https://hugo-alexa-portfolio.netlify.app/)

```
git clone https://github.com/Bonzdev/alexa-portfolio.git
```

Which was initially based on the HTML design using a template from [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27JtRAI3QO8&t=1512s) with some modifications and convert to hugo by the Alexa's authress.
